<h3>Fashion</h3>
<p style="color:pink">Fashion is a term used interchangeably to describe the creation of clothing, footwear, accessories, 
cosmetics, and jewellery of different cultural aesthetics and their mix and match into outfits 
that depict distinctive ways of dressing (styles and trends) as signifiers of social status, 
self-expression, and group belonging. As a multifaceted term, fashion describes an industry, styles, 
aesthetics, and trends.The term 'fashion' originates from the Latin word 'Facere,' which means 
'to make,' and describes the manufacturing, mixing, and wearing of outfits adorned with 
specific cultural aesthetics, patterns, motifs, shapes, and cuts, allowing people to showcase 
their group belonging, values, meanings, beliefs, and ways of life. 
Given the rise in mass production of commodities and clothing at lower prices and global reach, 
reducing fashion's environmental impact and improving sustainability has become an urgent issue 
among politicians, brands, and consumers.</p>
<h3>History of fashion</h3>
<p>Changes in clothing often took place at times of economic or social change, 
as occurred in ancient Rome and the medieval Caliphate, followed by a long period without 
significant changes. In eighth-century Moorish Spain, the musician Ziryab introduced to 
CÃ³rdoba[15][unreliable source][16] sophisticated clothing styles based on seasonal and 
daily fashions from his native Baghdad, modified by his inspiration. Similar changes in 
fashion occurred in the 11th century in the Middle East following the arrival of the Turks, 
who introduced clothing styles from Central Asia and the Far East</p>
